# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

--------

## Project Description

My project is tower defence.

## Game Logic
```
Draw a 20 by 20 grid
Draw a path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner
Mark the top left cell of the grid as the enemy spawn point
Mark the bottom right cell of the grid as your base

In order to win you must survive all 20 waves of enemies
Enemies will grow stronger every wave
During each wave all the enemies will spawn one after the other from their spawn point.
The enemies will try to reach your base and deal damage to it by ramming into it
If your base loses all it's "health" you lose
Build turrets along side the path to destroy the enemies!
Every enemy destroyed grants points
You can upgrade and build new turrets by spending points
```

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- Player will be able to build towers
- Enemies will spawn on a path
- Player loses when base is destroyed

### Post-MVP Plans

- Implement a system that gives certain towers "active abilities".
- Create a rudimentary map editor
- Create an online multiplayer VS mode utilizing node js and websocket
